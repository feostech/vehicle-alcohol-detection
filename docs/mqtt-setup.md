# MOSQUITTO MQTT SETUP: 

## Installation mosquitto in terminal:

https://mosquitto.org/download/ 

```
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:mosquitto-dev/mosquitto-ppa  

sudo apt-get install mosquitto 

sudo apt-get install mosquitto-clients
```
 
```
mosquitto or mosquitto -v 
```
 
```
systemctl restart mosquitto. services
```
```
mosquitto or mosquitto -v 
```
To check whether that error was coming or not. 

## Configuration methods: 

 

https://mosquitto.org/documentation/authentication-methods/  

https://test.mosquitto.org/config/

The above sites has the config method to make the connection successfully. 


### My mosquitto.conf file: 

```
 #Place your local configuration in /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/ 
 
 
 #A full description of the configuration file is at 

 #/usr/share/doc/mosquitto/examples/mosquitto.conf.example 

 persistence true 

 persistence_location /var/lib/mosquitto/ 

 log_dest file /var/log/mosquitto/mosquitto.log 

 include_dir /etc/mosquitto/conf.d  

 listener 1883          
 allow_anonymous true
```
 

## After configuring the file:

```
sudo mosquitto -c /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf  
```
Which is used to connected with the remote server (Mobile)

we need to give the mosquitto -c config with its < path > to make connection. 

In another terminal we need to get subscribe with our topic by using, 

```
mosquitto_sub -v -t "Topic_name"
```

 It shows the value that our client sends by using the mobile. 

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26716279/how-to-test-the-mosquitto-server (Ref. for Testing the server which we get to connect now.) 

open 3 terminal windows and each window should run these 3 different commands.
```
1:  sudo mosquitto -c /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf

2:  mosquitto_sub -v -t "Topic_name" 

3:  sudo tail -f /var/log/mosquitto/mosquitto.log 
```
 

### Checking the log whether the client is connected or not: 
```
sudo tail -f /var/log/mosquitto/mosquitto.log 
```
To check the client connectivity.
